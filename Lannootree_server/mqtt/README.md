## Setup

### SSL-TLS certificates (ca_certificates)

Generate certificates in the [certs](/certs/README.md) folder.

### files used

- ca.crt: own created certificate authoroty public key. Shared with te public clients
- server.crt: public key for server TLS
- server.key: Private key for mqtt server TLS

All the files need to be generated, the ca.crt needs to be shared with the clients.
It can be downloaded to the clients via [https://\<Domainname\>/ca.crt](https://\<Domainname\>/ca.crt)
